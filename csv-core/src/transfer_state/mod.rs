//! Transfer State Machine (Typestate Pattern)
//!
//! This module implements a typestate pattern for transfer states to enforce
//! valid state transitions at compile time. This prevents illegal mutations
//! and ensures protocol invariants are structurally enforced.
//!
//! ## Typestate Pattern
//!
//! Each state is a distinct type, and transitions are only possible through
//! specific methods that consume the current state and return the next state.
//! This makes invalid state transitions compile-time errors.
//!
//! ## States
//!
//! - **Locked**: Transfer is locked on source chain, awaiting proof
//! - **AwaitingFinality**: Proof submitted, awaiting finality confirmation
//! - **ProofBuilding**: Building zero-knowledge proof
//! - **ProofValidated**: Proof validated, ready for minting
//! - **Minting**: Minting on destination chain
//! - **Completed**: Transfer successfully completed
//! - **RolledBack**: Transfer rolled back due to reorg
//! - **Compromised**: Transfer compromised (security incident)
