//! Recovery Engine for Crash-Safe Startup
//!
//! This module provides the recovery engine that ensures the protocol
//! can recover safely from crashes, restarts, and reorgs.
//!
//! ## Startup Sequence
//!
//! The recovery engine executes the following startup sequence:
//! 1. Load persistent state from storage
//! 2. Validate state consistency
//! 3. Detect in-flight operations
//! 4. Resume or rollback incomplete operations
//! 5. Rebuild in-memory structures
//! 6. Verify chain finality
//! 7. Check for reorgs since last shutdown
//! 8. Apply necessary rollbacks
//! 9. Resume normal operation
//!
//! ## Backend Abstraction
//!
//! The recovery engine uses a [`RecoveryStorageBackend`] trait to abstract
//! the persistence layer. This allows csv-store (SQLite) or any other
//! storage implementation to be used.
//!
//! See [`csv_store::RecoveryStorageBackend`](https://docs.rs/csv-store/latest/csv_store/trait.RecoveryStorageBackend.html)
//! for the SQLite implementation.
