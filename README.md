**CSV Adapter** is a **client-side validation system** built on the **Universal Seal Primitive (USP)**. Rights are anchored to single-use seals on any chain. To transfer a Right, the seal is consumed on-chain and the new owner verifies the consumption proof locally, no bridges, no minting, no cross-chain messaging.

> We are not building a bridge. We are building a validation system where each chain enforces single-use at its strongest available guarantee, and clients verify everything else.

**Status: Audit findings F-01 through F-17 fixed. 630 tests pass. Property tests + fuzz targets added.** Cross-chain Right portability via client-side proof verification is implemented. Remaining work: live testnet deployment and full cross-chain execution.

### Code

```rust
use csv_adapter_bitcoin::BitcoinAnchorLayer;
use csv_adapter_core::{Hash, AnchorLayer};

// Create a Right anchored to a Bitcoin UTXO
let adapter = BitcoinAnchorLayer::signet()?;
let seal = adapter.create_seal(Some(100_000))?;
let commitment = Hash::new([0xAB; 32]);

// Publish commitment (anchors Right to chain)
let anchor = adapter.publish(commitment, seal)?;

// To transfer: spend the UTXO, give the receiver the proof
// Receiver verifies locally, no destination chain needed
```

## Philosophy

Client-Side Validation flips the blockchain paradigm: validation is pushed to the edges. Only contract participants verify state transitions. The blockchain provides commitment anchoring and single-use enforcement, not global validation.

**The USP insight:** different chains enforce single-use at different levels. Bitcoin does it structurally (UTXOs). Sui does it structurally (Objects). Aptos does it via type system (Move resources). Ethereum does it cryptographically (nullifier contracts). Rather than pretending these are equivalent, we model the degradation explicitly and let each chain enforce at its strongest available guarantee.

**Cross-chain portability:** a Right doesn't "move" between chains. It exists in the client's state, anchored to whichever chain's seal enforced its single-use. Any client can verify any seal's consumption proof. The Right is portable because the proof is verifiable, not because a bridge transferred anything.

Full specification: [docs/Blueprint.md](docs/Blueprint.md)

## How It Actually Works

### The Right Is Portable. The Seal Is Not

```
Alice owns Right A, anchored to Bitcoin UTXO X

Transfer to Bob:
1. Alice spends UTXO X          ← Bitcoin enforces single-use (structural)
2. Alice sends Bob: txid + Merkle proof
3. Bob's client verifies:
   ✓ UTXO X was spent           (chain-enforced)
   ✓ Merkle proof is valid      (client-verified)
   ✓ Right A's owner is now Bob (state transition)
4. Bob's client: Right A owner = Bob
   Right A is now anchored to Bob's UTXO Y (if Bob re-anchors)
   OR Right A exists off-chain with Bob as owner (if Bob holds)
```

**No destination chain.** No "minting" on another chain. No bridge tokens. Bob's client verified everything locally. The Right moves because the client accepted the proof.

### Cross-Chain Portability

A Right created on Bitcoin can be verified by a client that only knows about Ethereum. The client doesn't care which chain enforced the seal, it verifies the proof and accepts the state transition.

```
Bitcoin client:  "UTXO X was spent in block 299239"
                 Merkle proof: [branch₀, branch₁, ..., branch₅]
                 ✓ Verified

Ethereum client: "I don't know Bitcoin's UTXO model, but I can verify
                  this Merkle proof against Bitcoin's block header.
                  The proof is valid. I accept this state transition."
```

**This is the USP:** the `Right` type is chain-agnostic. Each chain maps its native primitive (UTXO, Object, Resource, Nullifier) to the same `Right`. Clients verify proofs uniformly regardless of which chain enforced the seal.

---

## Terminology

These terms have specific meanings. Confusing them is the most common source of misunderstanding.

### Right

A **Right** is the core portable primitive. It represents a transferrable claim that can be exercised at most once. Think of it as a digital bearer instrument, whoever holds the latest valid state transition owns it.

```rust
Right {
  id: Hash,               // Unique identifier: H(commitment || salt)
  commitment: Hash,       // Encodes state + rules
  owner: OwnershipProof,  // Cryptographic ownership (Ed25519/Secp256k1)
  salt: Vec<u8>,          // Stored for Right ID recomputation on deserialization
  nullifier: Option<Hash>,// Consumption marker (L3 only)
  state_root: Option<Hash>,
  execution_proof: Option<Proof>,
}
```

**Key properties:**

- A Right exists in **client state**, not on any chain
- A Right can be **transferred** (owner changes) without touching any chain
- A Right can be **anchored** to a chain's seal for on-chain enforcement
- A Right is **portable**, any client can verify any Right regardless of which chain anchored it

### Seal

A **Seal** is the on-chain mechanism that enforces a Right's single-use. Each chain has its own seal type:

| Chain | Seal Type | How It Works |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Bitcoin | UTXO | Spend the UTXO → seal consumed (gone forever) |
| Sui | Object | Delete/mutate the object → seal consumed |
| Aptos | Resource | Destroy the Move resource → seal consumed |
| Ethereum | Nullifier | Register nullifier in contract → seal consumed |

**Key distinction from Right:**

- A Right is **portable** (exists in client state)
- A Seal is **chain-specific** (exists on one chain only)
- A Right is **anchored to** a Seal (the seal enforces the Right's single-use)
- When a Seal is consumed, the Right's state transitions (new owner, etc.)

### Anchor

An **Anchor** is the link between a Right and its Seal. It records where the Right's single-use is enforced.

```rust
Anchor {
  seal_ref: SealRef,      // Which seal enforces this Right
  tx_hash: Hash,           // Transaction that consumed the seal
  block_height: u64,       // Block containing the transaction
}
```

**Key point:** A Right can exist without an Anchor (off-chain state transition). But to enforce single-use on-chain, it needs an Anchor.

### Commitment

A **Commitment** is a hash that encodes the current state of a Right and links to the previous state. Commitments form a chain:

```
Genesis Commitment
  ↓ hash
Commitment 1 (previous_commitment = hash(genesis))
  ↓ hash
Commitment 2 (previous_commitment = hash(commitment_1))
  ↓ hash
Latest Commitment
```

**Key properties:**

- Each commitment references the previous one (hash chain)
- The commitment chain proves the Right's state history is valid
- Clients verify the commitment chain from genesis to present
- Any break in the chain = invalid Right

### Client-Side Validation (CSV)

**CSV** means the client does the verification, not the blockchain. The chain only:

1. Records commitments (anchors them on-chain)
2. Enforces single-use of seals (UTXO spend, object deletion, etc.)

The client does **everything else**:

1. Fetches state history
2. Verifies commitment chain integrity
3. Checks no double-consumption
4. Accepts or rejects state transitions

**This is different from "smart contract validation"** where the chain verifies every state transition. In CSV, the chain doesn't know or care about state transitions, it only enforces that each seal is consumed once.

### Universal Seal Primitive (USP)

The **USP** is the insight that different chains enforce single-use at different levels, but they can all be modeled through the same `Right` type:

| Level | Name | Guarantee | Chains |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| L1 | Structural | Native single-use | Bitcoin, Sui |
| L2 | Type-Enforced | Language-level scarcity | Aptos |
| L3 | Cryptographic | Nullifier-based | Ethereum |

The **degradation rule** determines what each adapter does:

- If native single-use exists (L1): don't introduce nullifier
- If non-duplicable resource exists (L2): use resource lifecycle
- Otherwise (L3): require nullifier tracking

**The USP is what makes cross-chain portability possible.** A client doesn't care if a seal was a UTXO, Object, Resource, or Nullifier. It verifies the proof that the seal was consumed. The proof format differs per chain, but the verification logic is uniform.

### Consignment

A **Consignment** is a package of state transitions that a client receives from a peer. It contains:

- Genesis commitment
- All transitions (state changes)
- Seal assignments (which seals were consumed)
- Anchors (where transitions are recorded on-chain)

The client validates the consignment and accepts or rejects it.

---

## The Historical Path

### Where This Came From

CSV Adapter is built on concepts from **RGB Protocol** and **LNP/BP Standards**. RGB is a client-side validation protocol for Bitcoin that uses UTXOs as single-use seals. The insight was: *this pattern works on any chain, not just Bitcoin.*

### The Evolution

```
RGB Protocol (Bitcoin-only)
  └─ UTXOs as single-use seals
  └─ Client-side validation
  └─ Tapret commitments

       ↓ generalize

LNP/BP Standards (chain-agnostic)
  └─ Universal Seal Primitive (USP)
  └─ Degradation model (L1 → L2 → L3)
  └─ Canonical Right type

       ↓ implement

CSV Adapter (multi-chain)
  └─ Bitcoin: UTXO seals (L1 Structural)
  └─ Sui: Object seals (L1 Structural)
  └─ Aptos: Resource seals (L2 Type-Enforced)
  └─ Ethereum: Nullifier seals (L3 Cryptographic)
  └─ Cross-chain portability via client-side proof verification
```

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Degradation Over Simulation**

We don't pretend Ethereum has structural single-use. We model it honestly as L3 Cryptographic with a nullifier registry. This is weaker than L1 Structural, and the documentation says so.

**2. Canonical Right Type**

The `Right` struct is chain-agnostic. Each adapter maps its native primitive (UTXO, Object, Resource, Nullifier) to this type at the boundary. This is what makes cross-chain portability possible.

**3. No Bridges**

A Right doesn't "move" between chains. It exists in the client's state. When transferred, the seal is consumed on-chain and the new owner verifies the proof locally. No bridge, no minting, no cross-chain messaging.

**4. Client-Side, Not Chain-Side**

The chain doesn't validate state transitions. It only enforces single-use of seals. The client does all verification. This is the core of CSV and what makes it different from "smart contract" approaches.

## Cross-Chain Right Portability, ✅ COMPLETE

A Right created on one chain can be **transferred to any other chain** via the CLI:

```bash
# Bitcoin → Sui
csv cross-chain transfer --from bitcoin --to sui --right-id 0x...

# Sui → Ethereum
csv cross-chain transfer --from sui --to ethereum --right-id 0x...

# Bitcoin → Ethereum
csv cross-chain transfer --from bitcoin --to ethereum --right-id 0x...
```

**All inclusion proofs now fetch real data from RPC nodes:**

```
Bitcoin:  UTXO spent → Merkle proof → block header       ✅ Real data
Sui:      Object deleted → checkpoint proof → certification ✅ Real data
Aptos:    Resource destroyed → ledger proof → validator signatures ✅ Real data
Ethereum: Nullifier registered → MPT proof → receipt root  ✅ Real data
```

**Transfer flow (6 steps):**

1. **Lock** — Consume seal on source chain, emit event, generate inclusion proof
2. **Build proof** — Package lock event + inclusion proof + finality proof
3. **Verify** — Verify inclusion, finality, and CrossChainSealRegistry
4. **Check registry** — Ensure seal hasn't been consumed (double-spend prevention)
5. **Mint** — Create new Right on destination chain with same commitment
6. **Record** — Persist transfer in state for tracking

**Implemented traits:**

- `LockProvider` — Bitcoin, Sui, Aptos, Ethereum
- `TransferVerifier` — Universal (verifies proofs from any chain)
- `MintProvider` — Sui, Aptos, Ethereum (Bitcoin is UTXO-native, doesn't mint)

### Security by Verification Type

| Proof Type | Source Chain | Client Trust Model |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Merkle (Bitcoin) | Structural (UTXO) | Trustless — verifies against block header |
| Checkpoint (Sui) | Structural (Object) | Trustless — verifies certification |
| Ledger (Aptos) | Type-level (Resource) | Trustless — verifies validator signatures |
| MPT (Ethereum) | Cryptographic (Nullifier) | Trustless — verifies trie path |
