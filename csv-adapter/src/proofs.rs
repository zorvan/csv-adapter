//! Proof management facade.
//!
//! The [`ProofManager`] handles generation and verification of
//! cryptographic proofs for Rights and cross-chain transfers.
//!
//! # Proof Types
//!
//! - **Inclusion Proof**: Proves a transaction is included in a block
//! - **Finality Proof**: Proves a block is finalized at sufficient depth
//! - **ProofBundle**: Complete proof package (inclusion + finality)
