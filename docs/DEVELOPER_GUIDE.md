## Purpose

This guide is the practical entry point for contributors. It focuses on how to build, test, and extend the repository as it exists today.

## Prerequisites

The root workspace currently declares `rust-version = "1.75"`. Use a recent stable Rust toolchain unless you are reproducing an older environment.

Common local tooling:

```bash
rustup install stable
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

For chain-specific development, install the relevant tools only when you need them:

```bash
# Ethereum / Foundry
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup

# Sui CLI
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git --bin sui

# Aptos CLI
cargo install --git https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core.git aptos
```

## Repository map

### Adjacent packages in the monorepo

| Path | Role |
|------|------|

## Common commands

### Workspace

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

### CLI

```bash
cargo build -p csv-cli --release
./target/release/csv --help
```

### Package-level exploration

```bash
cargo test -p csv-adapter-core
cargo test -p csv-adapter-bitcoin
cargo test -p csv-adapter-ethereum
```

## Core concepts to keep in mind

| Concept | Practical meaning |
|---------|-------------------|
| `Right` | The portable client-side unit of state |
| `Seal` | The chain-native single-use primitive |
| `Commitment` | Hash-linked transition record |
| `ProofBundle` | The transportable verification artifact |
| `AnchorLayer` | The contract every adapter must satisfy |

If you need the conceptual model first, read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) before changing code.

## Working with the CLI

The CLI entry point in `csv-cli/src/main.rs` currently exposes these domains:

- `chain`
- `wallet`
- `right`
- `proof`
- `cross-chain`
- `contract`
- `seal`
- `test`
- `validate`

Use the CLI when you want to exercise integration behavior without writing new application code first.

## Extending the system

### Adding or modifying a chain adapter

The implementation pattern is:

1. Define chain-specific types in the adapter crate.
2. Implement `AnchorLayer`.
3. Wire chain-specific RPC and proof extraction.
4. Add tests for inclusion, finality, and replay behavior.
5. Expose the flow through `csv-cli` or the unified client if needed.

The most important file to understand first is `csv-adapter-core/src/traits.rs`.

### Adding higher-level product features

Decide which layer the feature belongs in:

| Feature type | Likely home |
|--------------|-------------|
| New proof or validation rule | `csv-adapter-core` |
| Chain-specific behavior | `csv-adapter-<chain>` |
| User workflow | `csv-cli` or `csv-adapter` |
| Wallet or explorer functionality | `csv-wallet` or `csv-explorer` |
| JS or agent-facing tooling | `typescript-sdk` or `csv-mcp-server` |

## Testing guidance

### Default loop

For most changes:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### Targeted loop

Use a smaller test target while iterating:

```bash
cargo test -p csv-adapter-core
cargo test -p csv-cli
```

### Testnet and manual flows

For guided operational testing, use:

- [E2E Testnet Manual](E2E_TESTNET_MANUAL.md)
- [Testnet E2E Report](TESTNET_E2E_REPORT.md)

## Documentation update rule

When a change affects behavior, update the matching canonical doc:

| If you changed... | Update... |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Protocol meaning or invariants | [Cross-Chain Specification](CROSS_CHAIN_SPEC.md) |
| System boundaries or package responsibilities | [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Build and workflow instructions | [Developer Guide](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) |
| Roadmap or future priorities | [Blueprint](BLUEPRINT.md) |

That rule is the main guardrail against documentation drift.

## Contributor checklist

Before you finish a change:

1. Run the smallest useful test command for the touched area.
2. Check whether the change affects a canonical doc.
3. Make sure README and docs still describe the current package layout.
4. Keep speculative roadmap material out of implementation docs.
