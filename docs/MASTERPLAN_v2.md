# CSV Protocol — Product & Marketing Masterplan
**Version**: 2.0  
**Revised**: May 2026  
**Audience**: Product, Marketing, Engineering, Business Development

---

## The One-Line Pitch

> **CSV is the verification primitive for a multi-chain world — move anything between any chain, prove it offline, no bridge, no prover infrastructure, no trusted party.**

---

## Part I: The Killer Demo (Before the Killer App)

Before you have a killer app, you need a killer demo. Before you have a killer demo, you need a working critical path.

The single demo that no competitor can replicate, that requires no whitepaper to explain, and that is within reach:

**"Turn off your WiFi. Scan this QR code."**

The result appears: ✅ Valid — Bitcoin → Solana — 2026-05-12 — Sealed.

This is the offline verification demo. It runs on a phone with no internet connection. It verifies a cross-chain proof bundle in under 200ms. It demonstrates the entire protocol value proposition in one gesture.

**Current status**: The cryptographic backend works. The wallet has a verification screen. The file import → verify → display flow is not wired. Estimated time to demo-ready: 2–3 weeks of focused engineering.

**This demo, filmed and posted to GitHub, is the launch. Everything else is secondary.**

---

## Part II: The Killer App

The killer app is the **CSV Passport Wallet** — but not as a general-purpose wallet. As a specialized cross-chain proof tool for developers and power users.

It does three things extremely well:

**Own your proofs.** Every Sanad (cross-chain asset passport) you hold is stored as a self-contained proof bundle on your device. You own it the same way you own a file. No custody during transit.

**Move anything.** Select an asset, select a destination chain, tap Move. Watch the state machine: Sealed → Awaiting Finality → Proof Built → Minted. No bridge fee line item. Just chain gas.

**Verify anything offline.** Import any proof bundle (QR or file). Turn off your WiFi. Get a valid/invalid result with the full chain of origin. This is the feature nobody else can build without rebuilding the entire protocol.

The wallet is a developer wallet and a proof verification tool. It is not competing with MetaMask or Phantom for consumer UX. That distinction must be maintained in every design decision.

---

## Part III: Segment Focus

### Stage 1 Segments (Do These Only)

#### Segment A — AI Agent Developers (Highest Narrative Value, 2026 Timing)

**The pain**: Autonomous AI agents executing cross-chain transactions have no way to verify each other's operations without a trusted intermediary. "I transferred your asset to Ethereum" is an assertion. With CSV, it becomes a verifiable proof bundle the receiving agent can check locally, with no API call.

**The product**:
- MCP server with 5 implemented tools: `create_seal`, `consume_seal`, `build_proof_bundle`, `verify_proof_bundle`, `initiate_cross_chain_transfer`
- TypeScript SDK published to npm as `@csv-protocol/sdk`
- 5 ready-to-run agent templates on GitHub:
  1. LangChain agent: moves an NFT from Solana to Sui when a price condition is met
  2. Claude tool-use integration using the MCP server
  3. AutoGPT agent: creates a credential seal and delivers the proof to a verifier
  4. Vercel AI SDK example with streaming transfer status
  5. Python agent using the CSV REST API

**Why this segment first**: In 2026, agent-to-agent trust is the unsolved problem every infrastructure developer is thinking about. CSV is the only primitive that provides a cryptographic answer. The MCP server exists. The TypeScript SDK exists. The marginal engineering to get here is low. The narrative value is the highest of any segment.

**Readiness**: 5/10 → 8/10 with MCP server implementation  
**Revenue model**: API calls (pay-per-proof), SDK licensing to agent frameworks  
**Marketing channel**: Hacker News, Latent Space newsletter, AI engineering communities, MCP ecosystem

---

#### Segment B — Web3 Game Studios (Fastest Time to Revenue)

**The pain**: Players buy items on one chain, cannot use them on another. Every studio that tries to solve this builds a custom bridge that eventually gets hacked. The Ronin incident is the case study every studio knows.

**The product**:
- Game Asset Passport SDK: a thin TypeScript/Unity wrapper around `csv-sdk`
- One function: `transfer_item(item_id, destination_chain, player_wallet)`
- Transfer state widget: shows the 7-step journey as a progress animation
- Item provenance explorer: shows item travel history by wallet address
- `examples/gaming.rs` productized as a proper quickstart

**Readiness**: 7/10 → 9/10 with wallet polish and real RPC wiring  
**Revenue model**: Per-transfer fee (sub-cent) or SDK licensing  
**Marketing channel**: Direct outreach to Sui and Solana game studios, Web3 gaming conferences, Ronin/Axie ecosystem developers

---

### Stage 2 Segments (Begin at 3–6 months post-launch)

#### Segment C — Cross-Chain DeFi (Atomic Seal Swap)

**Status**: Design is complete. Implementation is 0%. This is a 3–6 month engineering effort across 5 chain contracts simultaneously. Do not reference in external materials until the Bitcoin Tapscript hash-lock is implemented and testnet-verified.

**The milestone that unlocks this segment**: One live demo — two laptops, Bitcoin on one, Ethereum on the other, atomic swap completed with no escrow, no bridge, no middleman. This is the conference demo that changes the narrative.

---

#### Segment D — Decentralized Identity / Credentials

**Status**: Core seal lifecycle works. ZK privacy layer (credential verifier should not learn the value, only that it is valid) is 0% implemented. Do not position this segment until Pedersen commitments are complete.

**The milestone that unlocks this segment**: Single-use credential scan flow — scan QR, proof verified, seal consumed and marked unrepresentable. W3C VC adapter.

---

### Long-Term Directions (Stage 3+, Not Resourced Until Stage 2 Is Live)

**Supply Chain Provenance** — Physical custody handover as Sanad consumption. GS1 EPCIS adapter. Enterprise B2B SaaS. Long sales cycle, genuine fit.

**STARK IoT Proof Streams** — Batch verify 1024 sensor readings with one STARK proof, posted to Celestia DA layer. Technical showcase, not a product until Stage 3.

---

## Part IV: Critical Path to Stage 1 Launch

These items must be complete before any public marketing. They are ordered by priority.

### Must-Ship Before Demo

**1. Fix SV-01b — Ethereum finality proof unconditional acceptance**  
File: `csv-ethereum/src/ops.rs` → `verify_finality_proof`  
The `#[cfg(not(feature = "rpc"))]` block returns `Ok(true)`. Change to `Err(ChainOpError::FeatureNotEnabled(...))`.  
Estimated: 30 minutes. No reason to ship without it.

**2. Implement Ethereum contract deployment**  
File: `csv-ethereum/src/backend.rs` → `deploy_lock_contract`  
Currently returns `CapabilityUnavailable`. Deploy CSVLock.sol to Sepolia testnet.  
Estimated: 3–5 days.  
This is existential. Without Ethereum, CSV is a 4-chain protocol, and 70% of the developer market is unreachable.

**3. Implement P2P proof delivery (Nostr)**  
Files: `csv-p2p/src/nostr.rs`, `csv-p2p/src/proof_delivery.rs`  
The `nostr-sdk` dependency is declared. Implement `publish(proof, recipient_pubkey)` and `subscribe(my_sk, handler)`.  
Estimated: 1 week.  
Without this, cross-chain proof delivery cannot complete. The entire protocol story requires this component to be real.

**4. Wire offline verification UX**  
Wallet pages: `csv-wallet/src/pages/validate/offline.rs`  
File import → `verify_proof()` → display result (chain of origin, timestamp, valid/invalid).  
QR code import path must work on both web and mobile.  
Estimated: 1 week.  
This is the moat. Ship it before anything else is marketed.

**5. Desktop filesystem keystore**  
File: `csv-wallet/src/core/key_manager.rs` → `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` block  
Use `~/.csv/keys/{chain}/{keystore_id}.enc`, AES-256-GCM, Argon2id key derivation.  
Estimated: 2–3 days.  
Blocks CLI power users on native builds.

### Must-Ship for Stage 1 Marketing

**6. MCP server — 5 implemented tools**  
File: `csv-mcp-server/src/index.ts`  
Implement: `create_seal`, `consume_seal`, `build_proof_bundle`, `verify_proof_bundle`, `initiate_cross_chain_transfer`.  
Add proper TypeScript types, error handling, and streaming status.  
Estimated: 1–2 weeks.

**7. TypeScript SDK npm publish**  
Package: `@csv-protocol/sdk`  
Fix WASM chain_id bug first (SV-04, already in progress). Publish to npm with readme and code examples.

**8. 3 agent examples**  
GitHub repo: `csv-protocol/agent-examples`  
LangChain, Claude tool-use, Python REST. Each must run with `npm install && node example.js` or `pip install && python example.py`.

**9. Explorer live at public URL**  
Deploy to testnet. Wire WebSocket transfer status notifications.  
Link from wallet on every transfer status update.

## Part V: Positioning vs. Competitors

### Against Validator-Based Bridges

| Competitor | Their Angle | CSV Counter-Position |
|---|---|---|
| Wormhole | Universal messaging layer | We don't message. We prove. No guardian set to compromise. |
| LayerZero | Omnichain with DVNs | DVNs are configurable trusted parties. CSV has zero. |
| Axelar | Proof-of-stake validator bridge | Validators can collude. Cryptographic proofs cannot. |
| Chainlink CCIP | Battle-tested cross-chain | Battle-tested means battle-scarred. CSV has no bridge attack surface. |

### Against ZK Light Clients (The Relevant 2026 Competition)

| Competitor | Their Angle | CSV Counter-Position |
|---|---|---|
| Succinct Labs | ZK proof of consensus | They prove consensus. We prove asset state. No prover infrastructure. Offline-verifiable. |
| zkBridge / Polyhedra | ZK bridge, fast finality | Same infrastructure dependency. CSV proof bundles are self-contained — no verifier query. |

**The key message**: ZK light clients prove that a chain said something. CSV proves that a specific asset commitment was used exactly once. These are different claims. Ours requires less infrastructure, costs less per operation, and is verifiable offline.

### Against IBC

| Competitor | Their Angle | CSV Counter-Position |
|---|---|---|
| IBC | Packet relay, light clients | IBC requires both chains to maintain each other's light clients. CSV does not. Any two chains that support single-use semantics can interoperate immediately. |

---

## Part VI: Messaging Rules

**Say this:**
- "Client-verifiable" instead of "trustless" (overused, doubted)
- "No bridge, no operator required" instead of "decentralized" (empty)
- "Proof delivery" instead of "bridge transfer"
- "Sanad (cross-chain asset passport)" on first reference, then "Sanad"
- "CSV (Client-Side Validation) Protocol" on first reference, then "CSV"

**Never say:**
- "Trustless" — every bridge says this
- "ZK" — until Pedersen commitments are implemented and demonstrable
- "Post-quantum by default" — until it is, in fact, the default signing scheme
- "Atomic swap" — in any external material until the Bitcoin Tapscript hash-lock is testnet-verified

**Lead with the user benefit**, not the architecture:
- "Verify ownership offline" comes before "hash-committed state transition"
- "No bridge fee" comes before "client-side validated proof bundle"
- "Your assets, your proof, your device" comes before explaining what a Sanad is

---

## Part VII: Launch Sequence

### Stage 1 — Developer Alpha (Now → MVP)

**Goal**: 50 developers running real proof operations on testnet. One integration partner in conversation.

**Ships**:

**Marketing actions**:
- Conference demo: atomic swap on two laptops, live, no bridge
- Co-authored blog posts with game studio partner: "How we eliminated bridge risk for [game]"
- AI agent gallery on docs site

---

### Stage 3 — Enterprise Pipeline (6–12 months post-Stage 1)

**Goal**: 1 paid enterprise pilot. Protocol fee revenue beginning.

**Ships**:
- Supply chain provenance schema + GS1 EPCIS adapter
- Enterprise explorer dashboard (whitelabeled)
- Full ZK privacy layer (stealth addresses + Pedersen)
- Post-quantum ML-DSA-65 as default (not optional feature)
- Fraud proof challenge mechanism (Celestia-backed)

---

### Stage 4 — Network Effects (12–18 months)

**Goal**: Third parties building on CSV without hand-holding. Self-sustaining developer ecosystem.

**Ships**:
- STARK IoT proof stream + live dashboard
- Integration into 2 new chains via grant programs
- AI agent gallery: 10+ maintained examples across 5 frameworks
- EthGlobal / Sui Hacker House: CSV bounty track

---

## Part VIII: The Fee Model

Every developer considering integration will ask: "Who pays for the destination chain mint?"

**The answer**: Fee escrow in source-chain native token.

When a transfer is initiated, the sender escrows a small amount of the source chain's native asset (e.g., a few basis points of gas equivalent). This amount is released to the proof-delivery operator upon cryptographic confirmation of successful destination mint. No new token is issued. Operators run Nostr relay nodes and are economically incentivized by the escrow release. The protocol enforces this at the smart contract level.

This model:
- Requires no new token (correct — no token before Series A)
- Aligns proof-delivery node operator incentives
- Is verifiable on-chain
- Has a clear answer for every partner question about economics

---

---

## Part X: What Not to Build

**Do not build a DEX.** CSV is infrastructure. Let others build swaps on top.

**Do not build a chain.** CSV is chain-agnostic by design. Adding a native chain destroys the positioning.

**Do not issue a token** (yet). Protocol tokens invite regulatory risk and distract from proof-of-value for enterprise partners. Design it post-Series A if needed.

**Do not compete with MetaMask or Phantom on consumer UX.** The CSV wallet is a developer wallet and a proof verification tool. Keep it specialized.

**Do not pitch VCs before Stage 2.** The story only lands when 3 real integrations exist generating real proof bundles on mainnet. Before that it is a demo with a whitepaper.

**Do not market ZK features until they exist.** Credibility is the only thing a pre-token infrastructure protocol has.

**Do not let the supply chain or IoT segments distract engineering before Stage 2.** They are correct long-term bets but wrong immediate investments.

---

## The Three Things That Win

**1. Ship the offline verification demo.**  
One video of "WiFi off, proof verified in 200ms" beats every whitepaper. This is the only thing no competitor can show. It is 2–3 weeks of wiring away. It is the launch.

**2. Be the trust layer for AI agents.**  
In 2026, agent-to-agent trust is the unsolved problem. CSV has the MCP server, the TypeScript SDK, and the proof primitive. Five good agent examples and one HN post can own this narrative before anyone else claims it.

**3. Keep the "no trusted party" story clean.**  
Every product decision, every integration, every feature must pass one test: "does this add a trusted party?" If yes, kill it. The moat is the proof model. Protect it.
