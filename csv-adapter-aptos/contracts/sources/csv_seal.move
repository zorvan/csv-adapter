//! CSV Seal Module for Aptos
//!
//! This Move module provides seal management for the CSV (Client-Side Validation) adapter.
//! Seals are resources that can be consumed exactly once to anchor commitments on-chain.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Seals in Aptos are implemented as resources with a consumed flag and AnchorData storage.
//! Unlike the minimal version that simply deletes resources, this version provides:
//! - Consumed state tracking (seals are marked consumed, not deleted)
//! - AnchorData persistence (commitment stored on-chain after consumption)
//! - Transfer functionality (seals can be transferred between accounts)
//! - Timestamp tracking (consumption time recorded)
//! - Multiple seals per account via LinearCollection pattern
//!
//! ## Usage Flow
//!
//! 1. **Seal Creation**: Mint seal objects via `create_seal`
//! 2. **Seal Transfer**: Transfer seals between accounts via `transfer_seal`
//! 3. **Seal Consumption**: Call `consume_seal` to mark consumed and emit event
//! 4. **Verification**: Verify the event was emitted with the correct commitment data
//!
//! ## Error Codes
//!
//! - `ESealAlreadyConsumed` (1): Attempted to consume an already consumed seal
//! - `ESealNotConsumed` (2): Attempted operation requiring consumed seal
//! - `EAnchorDataExists` (3): AnchorData already exists for this seal
//! - `ESealNotFound` (4): Seal object not found
