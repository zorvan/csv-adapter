//! Core Chain Operation Traits
//!
//! This module defines the standardized traits that all chain adapters must implement
//! for production use. These traits provide a unified interface for:
//!
//! - **ChainQuery**: Querying balances, transactions, and chain state
//! - **ChainSigner**: Deriving addresses and signing transactions/messages
//! - **ChainBroadcaster**: Submitting and confirming transactions
//! - **ChainDeployer**: Deploying contracts and programs
//! - **ChainProofProvider**: Building and verifying cryptographic proofs
//! - **ChainRightOps**: Managing rights (create, consume, lock, mint, refund)
//!
//! All adapters must implement these traits to be registered in the production registry.
